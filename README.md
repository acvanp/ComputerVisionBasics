# ComputerVisionBasics
Basic examples of image classification and object detection. This demonstrates basic proficiency and useful tidbits that can be applied to other projects.

1) Image classification using the Kaggle Petal to the Metal example.
	* Use TF record format for efficient memory usage.
	* Use albumentations for efficient image augmentation.
2) Object detection using YOLO with a bounding box widget.
	* Have a handy bounding box widget so you can label a data set from scratch if necessary.
	* Learn how to configure YOLO and work through dependency mismatches in order to get up and running.
